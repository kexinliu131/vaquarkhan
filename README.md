## Definition 

Microservice architecture, or simply microservices, is a distinctive method of developing software systems that tries to focus on building single-function modules with well-defined interfaces and operations. The trend has grown popular in recent years as Enterprises look to become more Agile and move towards a DevOps and continuous testing. Microservices can help create scalable, testable software that can be delivered weekly, not yearly.

* As a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API
* Services are built around business capabilities
* services are independently deployable and scalable
* Bare minimum of centralized management of these services
* Services may be written in different programming languages(polyglot development).
* Services should use separate data storage (polyglot persistence ).

The Microservices approach is about breaking your system ("pile of code") into many small services, each typically has its own:

* Clear business-related responsibility
* Running process
* Database
* Code version control (e.g. git) repository
* API (the protocol how other services / clients will contact the Microservice)
* UI


## Why-Microservice 
![Alt Text](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTLZc-LdXFX_xqNCIup-yjaBBg7StcER0cLWR8Ofh5CjkSj6tOv)

* Microservice make our system loosely coupled, i.e. if we need to update, repair, or replace a Microservice, we don't need to rebuild our entire application, just swap out the part that needs it.
* To built each Microservice can use different languages and tools. Microservices communicate with well defined interface
* The communication should be stateless for scalability(copies of Microservice) and reliability(one copy fail other copy can serve), the most common methods for communication between Microservices are HTTP and messaging.
Each Microservice should have it's own datastore.
* Small team capable to work on design, web development, coding, database admin and operations.


## Pros-and-cons

Sam Newman in Building Microservices, enumerates the key benefits of Microservices as following:

#### Technology Heterogeneity
With a system composed of multiple, collaborating services, we can decide to use different technologies inside each one. This allows us to pick the right tool for each job, rather than having to select a more standardized, one-size-fits-all approach that often ends up being the lowest common denominator.

#### Resilience
A key concept in resilience engineering is the bulkhead. If one component of a system fails, but that failure doesn’t cascade, you can isolate the problem and the rest of the system can carry on working. Service boundaries become your obvious bulkheads. In a monolithic service, if the service fails, everything stops working. With a monolithic system, we can run on multiple machines to reduce our chance of failure, but with microservices, we can build systems that handle the total failure of services and degrade functionality accordingly.

#### Scaling
With a large, monolithic service, we have to scale everything together. One small part of our overall system is constrained in performance, but if that behavior is locked up in a giant monolithic application, we have to handle scaling everything as a piece. With smaller services, we can just scale those services that need scaling, allowing us to run other parts of the system on smaller, less powerful hardware.

#### Ease of Deployment
A one-line change to a million-line-long monolithic application requires the whole application to be deployed in order to release the change. That could be a large-impact, high-risk deployment. In practice, large-impact, high-risk deployments end up happening infrequently due to understandable fear.

With microservices, we can make a change to a single service and deploy it independently of the rest of the system. This allows us to get our code deployed faster. If a problem does occur, it can be isolated quickly to an individual service, making fast rollback easy to achieve.

#### Organizational Alignment
Microservices allow us to better align our architecture to our organization, helping us minimize the number of people working on any one codebase to hit the sweet spot of team size and productivity. We can also shift ownership of services between teams to try to keep people working on one service collocated.

#### Composability
One of the key promises of distributed systems and service-oriented architectures is that we open up opportunities for reuse of functionality. With microservices, we allow for our functionality to be consumed in different ways for different purposes. This can be especially important when we think about how our consumers use our software.

#### Optimizing for Replaceability
If you work at a medium-size or bigger organization, chances are you are aware of some big, nasty legacy system sitting in the corner. The one no one wants to touch. The one that is vital to how your company runs, but that happens to be written in some odd Fortran variant and runs only on hardware that reached end of life 25 years ago. Why hasn’t it been replaced? You know why: it’s too big and risky a job.

With our individual services being small in size, the cost to replace them with a better implementation, or even delete them altogether, is much easier to manage.

### Cons
* It is very difficult to maintain multiple Microservices.
* It is very difficult to maintain versioning among Microservices.
* It is extremely difficult to find good architects for creating Microservice architecture in right way.
* Increased Complexity
* Competency needed to manage and deploy the microservices,devops

# API Design 
1. Build the API with consumers in mind--as a product in its own right.
    * Not for a specific UI.
    * Embrace flexibility / tunability of each endpoint (see #5, 6 & 7).
    * Eat your own dogfood, even if you have to mockup an example UI.


1. Use the Collection Metaphor.
    * Two URLs (endpoints) per resource:
        * The resource collection (e.g. /orders)
        * Individual resource within the collection (e.g. /orders/{orderId}).
    * Use plural forms (‘orders’ instead of ‘order’).
    * Alternate resource names with IDs as URL nodes (e.g. /orders/{orderId}/items/{itemId})
    * Keep URLs as short as possible. Preferably, no more-than three nodes per URL.

1. Use nouns as resource names (e.g. don’t use verbs in URLs).

1. Make resource representations meaningful.
    * “No Naked IDs!” No plain IDs embedded in responses. Use links and reference objects.
    * Design resource representations. Don’t simply represent database tables.
    * Merge representations. Don’t expose relationship tables as two IDs.

1. Support filtering, sorting, and pagination on collections.

1. Support link expansion of relationships. Allow clients to expand the data contained in the response by including additional representations instead of, or in addition to, links.

1. Support field projections on resources. Allow clients to reduce the number of fields that come back in the response.

1. Use the HTTP method names to mean something:
    * POST - create and other non-idempotent operations.
    * PUT - update.
    * GET - read a resource or collection.
    * DELETE - remove a resource or collection.

1. Use HTTP status codes to be meaningful.
    * 200 - Success.
    * 201 - Created. Returned on successful creation of a new resource. Include a 'Location' header with a link to the newly-created resource.
    * 400 - Bad request. Data issues such as invalid JSON, etc.
    * 404 - Not found. Resource not found on GET.
    * 409 - Conflict. Duplicate data or invalid data state would occur.

1. Use ISO 8601 timepoint formats for dates in representations.

1. Consider connectedness by utilizing a linking strategy. Some popular examples are:
    * [HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html)
    * [Siren](https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren)
    * [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/)
    * [Collection+JSON](http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/)

1. Use [OAuth2](http://oauth.net/2/) to secure your API.
    * Use a Bearer token for authentication.
    * Require HTTPS / TLS / SSL to access your APIs. OAuth2 Bearer tokens demand it. Unencrypted communication over HTTP allows for simple eavesdroppping and impersonation.

1. Use Content-Type negotiation to describe incoming request payloads.

    For example, let's say you're doing ratings, including a thumbs-up/thumbs-down and five-star rating. You have one route to create a rating: **POST /ratings**

    How do you distinguish the incoming data to the service so it can determine which rating type it is: thumbs-up or five star?

    The temptation is to create one route for each rating type: **POST /ratings/five_star** and **POST /ratings/thumbs_up**

    However, by using Content-Type negotiation we can use our same **POST /ratings** route for both types. By setting the *Content-Type* header on the request to something like **Content-Type: application/vnd.company.rating.thumbsup** or **Content-Type: application/vnd.company.rating.fivestar** the server can determine how to process the incoming rating data.

1. Evolution over versioning. However, if versioning, use the Accept header instead of versioning in the URL.
    * Versioning via the URL signifies a 'platform' version and the entire platform must be versioned at the same time to enable the linking strategy.
    * Versioning via the Accept header is versioning the resource.
    * Additions to a JSON response do not require versioning. However, additions to a JSON request body that are 'required' are troublesome--and may require versioning.
    * Hypermedia linking and versioning is troublesome no matter what--minimize it.
    * Note that a version in the URL, while discouraged, can be used as a 'platform' version. It should appear as the first node in the path and not version individual endpoints differently (e.g. api.example.com/v1/...).

1. Consider Cache-ability. At a minimum, use the following response headers:
    * ETag - An arbitrary string for the version of a representation. Make sure to include the media type in the hash value, because that makes a different representation. (ex: ETag: "686897696a7c876b7e")
    * Date - Date and time the response was returned (in RFC1123 format). (ex: Date: Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT)
    * Cache-Control - The maximum number of seconds (max age) a response can be cached. However, if caching is not supported for the response, then no-cache is the value. (ex: Cache-Control: 360 or Cache-Control: no-cache)
    * Expires - If max age is given, contains the timestamp (in RFC1123 format) for when the response expires, which is the value of Date (e.g. now) plus max age. If caching is not supported for the response, this header is not present. (ex: Expires: Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT)
    * Pragma - When Cache-Control is 'no-cache' this header is also set to 'no-cache'. Otherwise, it is not present. (ex: Pragma: no-cache)
    * Last-Modified - The timestamp that the resource itself was modified last (in RFC1123 format). (ex: Last-Modified: Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT)

1. Ensure that your GET, PUT, and DELETE operations are all [idempotent](http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/idempotency.html).  There should be no adverse side affects from operations.


## Documentation & Modeling

### REST APIs

## Pragmatic REST

These guidelines aim to support a truly RESTful API. Here are a few exceptions:
* Put the version number of the API in the URL (see examples below). Don’t accept any requests that do not specify a version number.
* Allow users to request formats like JSON or XML like this:
    * http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines.json
    * http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines.xml

## RESTful URLs

### General guidelines for RESTful URLs
* A URL identifies a resource.
* URLs should include nouns, not verbs.
* Use plural nouns only for consistency (no singular nouns).
* Use HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to operate on the collections and elements.
* You shouldn’t need to go deeper than resource/identifier/resource.
* Put the version number at the base of your URL, for example http://example.com/v1/path/to/resource.
* URL v. header:
    * If it changes the logic you write to handle the response, put it in the URL.
    * If it doesn’t change the logic for each response, like OAuth info, put it in the header.
* Specify optional fields in a comma separated list.
* Formats should be in the form of api/v2/resource/{id}.json

### Good URL examples
* List of magazines:
    * GET http://www.example.gov/api/v1/magazines.json
* Filtering is a query:
    * GET http://www.example.gov/api/v1/magazines.json?year=2011&sort=desc
    * GET http://www.example.gov/api/v1/magazines.json?topic=economy&year=2011
* A single magazine in JSON format:
    * GET http://www.example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234.json
* All articles in (or belonging to) this magazine:
    * GET http://www.example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234/articles.json
* All articles in this magazine in XML format:
    * GET http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234/articles.xml
* Specify optional fields in a comma separated list:
    * GET http://www.example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234.json?fields=title,subtitle,date
* Add a new article to a particular magazine:
    * POST http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234/articles

### Bad URL examples
* Non-plural noun:
    * http://www.example.gov/magazine
    * http://www.example.gov/magazine/1234
    * http://www.example.gov/publisher/magazine/1234
* Verb in URL:
    * http://www.example.gov/magazine/1234/create
* Filter outside of query string
    * http://www.example.gov/magazines/2011/desc

## HTTP Verbs

HTTP verbs, or methods, should be used in compliance with their definitions under the [HTTP/1.1](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html) standard.
The action taken on the representation will be contextual to the media type being worked on and its current state. Here's an example of how HTTP verbs map to create, read, update, delete operations in a particular context:

| HTTP METHOD | POST            | GET       | PUT         | DELETE |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------ |
| CRUD OP     | CREATE          | READ      | UPDATE      | DELETE |
| /dogs       | Create new dogs | List dogs | Bulk update | Delete all dogs |
| /dogs/1234  | Error           | Show Bo   | If exists, update Bo; If not, error | Delete Bo |

(Example from Web API Design, by Brian Mulloy, Apigee.)


## Responses

* No values in keys
* No internal-specific names (e.g. "node" and "taxonomy term")
* Metadata should only contain direct properties of the response set, not properties of the members of the response set

### Good examples

No values in keys:

    "tags": [
      {"id": "125", "name": "Environment"},
      {"id": "834", "name": "Water Quality"}
    ],


### Bad examples

Values in keys:

    "tags": [
      {"125": "Environment"},
      {"834": "Water Quality"}
    ],


## Error handling

Error responses should include a common HTTP status code, message for the developer, message for the end-user (when appropriate), internal error code (corresponding to some specific internally determined ID), links where developers can find more info. For example:

    {
      "status" : 400,
      "developerMessage" : "Verbose, plain language description of the problem. Provide developers
       suggestions about how to solve their problems here",
      "userMessage" : "This is a message that can be passed along to end-users, if needed.",
      "errorCode" : "444444",
      "moreInfo" : "http://www.example.gov/developer/path/to/help/for/444444,
       http://drupal.org/node/444444",
    }

Use three simple, common response codes indicating (1) success, (2) failure due to client-side problem, (3) failure due to server-side problem:
* 200 - OK
* 400 - Bad Request
* 500 - Internal Server Error


## Versions

* Never release an API without a version number.
* Versions should be integers, not decimal numbers, prefixed with ‘v’. For example:
    * Good: v1, v2, v3
    * Bad: v-1.1, v1.2, 1.3
* Maintain APIs at least one version back.


## Record limits

* If no limit is specified, return results with a default limit.
* To get records 51 through 75 do this:
    * http://example.gov/magazines?limit=25&offset=50
    * offset=50 means, ‘skip the first 50 records’
    * limit=25 means, ‘return a maximum of 25 records’

Information about record limits and total available count should also be included in the response. Example:

    {
        "metadata": {
            "resultset": {
                "count": 227,
                "offset": 25,
                "limit": 25
            }
        },
        "results": []
    }

        }
    ]


## Mock Responses
It is suggested that each resource accept a 'mock' parameter on the testing server. Passing this parameter should return a mock data response (bypassing the backend).

Implementing this feature early in development ensures that the API will exhibit consistent behavior, supporting a test driven development methodology.

Note: If the mock parameter is included in a request to the production environment, an error should be raised.
